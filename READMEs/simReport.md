Answering the Sim Questions
---
1. How does the maximum number of predators supported by a system depend on how much stockpile is needed to reproduce in the predator lifecycle?  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To Answer this question, the only assumption I made to answer this question was to assume that "the maximum number of predators **supported** by a system" meant that the maximum predators **supported** would have to be the maximum amount of predators that had to be on screen at the same time, regardless if they survived past 1 step. I ran the simulation 10 times, increasing the reproduction stock variable by 10 each time, starting from 20-110. After I ran that sim 10 times, I continued to run that loop of simulations another 43 times to get a wide range of data. From there, I graphed the reproduction stock versus the average maximum number of predators.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The data here ended up behaving exactly how I expected. As you can see, the sim allowed fewer predators with the lower reproduction stock number starting with 1.5 predators at reproduction stock 20. The number of predators the system sustained kept drastically increasing until it reached a peak number of predators at the reproduction stock of 60, with a maximum average predator count of around 3.5. After that, the number of predators the system allowed decreased through a reproduction stock of 110 with a minimum average predator count of around 3.0. The red error bars on each bar of the graph are the standard errors of the mean. All of the error bars are relatively small spanning less than 1 unit on the y-axis, with 50 and 60 reproduction stocks having the largest error bars and 20, 30, and 110 having the smaller error bars, meaning that the reproduction stocks with the lower number of predators has a more accurate mean/average than the stocks with higher means/averages. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This graph makes sense because, with a lower amount of reproduction stock, the parent cell would reproduce more quickly and have the chance to die quicker. With the reproduction stock also being low when reproducing, the baby cells also have a higher chance of living a short amount of time because they start with a lower stock and may use it up before they get the chance to fuel it up. It also makes sense that there would be a lower amount of predators in the system with the higher reproduction stock because it would take longer and harder for those predators to gain enough energy to reproduce, especially with a step limit placed on the simulation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the end, the reproduction stock of 60 allowed for the most amount of predators in the simulation. The maximum number of predators supported by a system depends on the reproduction stock, time limits, and the percentage of the parent cell stock that is split when it does reproduce.

2. How does the length of a predator's life depend on the efficiency of its energy consumption (e.g., how many units of 'food' it gains per cell it 'eats')?  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To answer this question, I had to dive into what variables all went into the length of a predator's life. The data collection was similar to question 1's data collection, with running the simulation 8 times, increasing the stock gained by 0.5 every time, and repeating the data collection process multiple times. In my first version of collecting data, all of my data came out relatively equal, which meant that I couldn't conclude how the length of a predator's life depended on its energy consumption. <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As you can see, here all of the lifespans show no correlation with the stock gained from eating. I inferred this behavior was due to the predators with lower stocks gained living longer because they wouldn't have to reproduce and have the parent die early 50% of the time while the higher stocks had to deal with that more frequently, throwing off the averages. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That was when I just increased the number of stock a predator would gain when it ate living cells. When I took into account that the stock the predator would need to reproduce and made the stock the predator would need to reproduce increase with the stock they would gain from eating, it made the cell reproduction more balanced. <br>

This graph was made with the 'GOLQ2WeightedRepo.csv'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This graph shows the average predator lifespan within a simulation of the Game of Life at different stocks/energy gained from eating living cells. As you can see there is a positive, upward slope of the average lifespan as you increase the simulation stock gained from eating cells throughout the whole graph (0.5-4.0). The red error bars show the standard error of the average lifespans of predators, which increase as the stock gained from eating cells increases. This means that the average lifespan of a predator recorded here is less accurate than the average/mean presented in the graph. These error bars overlap, but they still show that the lifespans increase because the error never dips below the error of the bar preceding it. This graph makes sense because a higher amount of stock gained from eating should allow the predator to survive longer from the energy they lose from moving and reproduction.  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the end, the length of a predator's life positively correlates with its efficiency of energy consumption and also with its reproduction stock required. The reproduction process can mess with the results of the lifespan of predators due to the parent dying 50% of the time. Other than that, the predator has a higher chance of living a long time in the simulation with higher stock/energy gained from reproduction.

3. If the base rules of the Game of Life are changed, such that the cells have evolved to survive under conditions with 4 surrounding neighbors (but perish with 5 neighbors), does this increase or decrease the maximum number of predators that can be sustained in the system?  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The data collection for this question was very similar to the data collection for the first question. All that was different about the data collected here was that I ran two simulation states at once so the predator starting positions would be the same for the two states. I did that to eliminate any compounding variables in this simulation. Since the question was very similar to the first question in that we were trying to find the maximum amount of predators in the simulation, I decided to collect the same data for the same variables. I put both of the simulation data on the same graph so it would easily be comparable. <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just as I predicted, the maximum amount of predators that the simulation could sustain increased due to the number of living cells increased for the normal Game of Life. The original Game of Life rules don't allow for the maximum amount of predators to reach above 10, while the new Game of Life rules allow for the maximum amount of predators in a simulation to reach from around 20-50. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One thing I found interesting with this data though, was that the standard errors of the Game of Life with the new rule were much higher than the standard error of the normal Game of Life rules. It is also noted that the number of predators within the system drastically increased from the original simulation. I would like to note though, that both simulations follow a similar trend line as each other and the data collected in the first question, it's just harder to see with the scaling of the y-axis with the red(original) simulation. The maximum predators peaks around stock 50, and decreases from there. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The new Game of Life rules though have a little sooner of a peak, around stock 40. This makes sense because more stock would allow the predators to reproduce more and hence, have more premature deaths. This also makes the standard error bars big size make sense because, due to the reproduction distribution options chosen, some simulations may get luckier and have a lot more predator parents live, while others may die more often, making the differences in simulation deaths much bigger than the previous Game of Life rules. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all, the new Game of Life rule increased the maximum number of predators that can be sustained in a system drastically, around 5 times worth at least. This new rule added more variability in the accuracy of predicting the maximum amount of predators in the system though and made the maximum predators simulation stock decrease to 40 instead of the normal Game of Life that peaked around stock 50-60.
